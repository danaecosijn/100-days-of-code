# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Goal for my 100 days of code**: At the end of these 100 days of code I want to be finished the Skillcrush courses on Front End Development & Wordpress.

**Stretch goal for my 100 days of code**: My stretch goal for these 100 days of code is to finish the Phyton courses as well and finished the Woo / Exact automation I want to create.


### Day 1: February 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished Skillcrush Git & Github and started on Skillcrush Responsive Websites

**Thoughts** Git & Github course was a breeze although I do feel like I need some more practice with working with teams. The responsive websites course is not very advanced at the moment just learned how media types work.

### Day 2: February 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Skillcrush Responsive Websites course & Started on the FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page.

**Thoughts**: Responsive website course on Skillcrush is really easy. When checking the FreeCodeCamp curriculum for HTML & CSS I found that there are quite a few things that Skillcrush did not cover in their HTML & CSS courses. Therefore I think it is wise to go through the FCC curriculum as well. Also setting up the FCC project was quite easy and having to push everything to Github is a great way to make sure that working with Git & Terminal gets better each day.

### Day 3: February 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Skillcrush Responsive Websites course.

**Thoughts**: Currently working on getting to know flexbox. It's still a bit weird, I think using it some more in several projects including the FCC project will help quite a bit.
