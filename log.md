# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Goal for my 100 days of code**: At the end of these 100 days of code I want to be finished the Skillcrush courses on Front End Development & Wordpress.

**Stretch goal for my 100 days of code**: My stretch goal for these 100 days of code is to finish the Phyton coursees as well and finished the Woo / Exact Online automation I want to create.

### Day 1: February 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished Skillcrush Git & Github and started on Skillcrush Responsive Websites

**Thoughts** Git & Github course was a breeze although I do feel like I need some more practice with working with teams. The responsive websites course is not very advanced at the moment just learned how media types work.
